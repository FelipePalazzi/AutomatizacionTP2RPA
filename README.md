# ✈️ Automation TP2 RPA - TurismoCity with TagUI

This project was developed as part of **Practical Assignment #2 for RPA**, where we built a bot using **TagUI** to automate the search for cheap flights on [Turismo City](https://www.turismocity.com.ar/) and send the results to **Discord**.

## 📌 Project Description

The automation performs the following steps:

1. Automatically accesses the Turismo City website.  
2. Fills in the **origin** and **destination** fields.  
3. Searches for available flights.  
4. Takes a screenshot of the results page.  
5. Sends that screenshot to a **Discord** channel.  

This way, we combined **web automation + real-time notifications**, making it easier to find cheap flights and instantly receive them in our Discord.
